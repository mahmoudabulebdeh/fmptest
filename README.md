# What I'm pleased with:

Having previously read and studied test driven development (TDD), I can say that I am pleased that I have had the chance to implement it within the process.
TDD, is a useful software development process, as it guarantees the programme to pass the test from the start as well as continuously testing it throughout the process. Additionally, this can help in reducing costs, shortening testing cycles and achieve continuous feedback on quality.
Besides having learned about TDD, I also had the chance to practice Jasmine and Karma which is used for the JavaScript unit test.
